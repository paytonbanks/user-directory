## Description
The application was built using Model View Control(MVC) design architecture. A MVC design approach divdes the program logic into the three interconnected elements: *Model* for data manipulation, *View* also known as user interface, and *Controller* that works as data dispatcher for the full system design. The application is supported and deployed with React and deployed to Heroku.
